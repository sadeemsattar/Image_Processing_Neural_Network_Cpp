# Image_Processing_Neural_Network_Cpp
This is the semester third Image Processing Neural Network in C++ Project for Data Structure Project presented to Dr. Muhammad Rafi.

# Introduction
The Image Processing Neural Network is based on the training and testing of black and white image using Feed Forward and Back Propagation Deep Learning.

The aim of this project is to determine accuracy of identifying the images.

The sigmoid activation function is also used.

# Data Structure
Multi Dimensional Array were implemented to store the data and to process.

# Data-Set
The mnist data set from Kaggle was used.
